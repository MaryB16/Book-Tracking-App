# Book Tracking App [Demo](https://book-tracking-app.herokuapp.com/)

This is the 7th project that I did for Udacity Front-End program during my Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship. It was made with React. 

## Description
The application was written from scratch (with scaffolding by [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))

It follows the Udacity guidelines/requirements and it's using a web service provided by them 
( You can find more information about the database [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) )

The application lets the user add books to a virtual bookshelf. It displays the books under three categorized bookshelves: currently reading, want to read and read. The user searches the books in a database and he can add books, from the search page, to one of the three bookshelves. 

## Getting Started

In order to run this app on your computer all you need to do is:
* `git clone` then `npm start`
    
### Important note about the backend

Udacity has limited the search to a particular set of terms that can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md). Other search terms *will not* return any results.
