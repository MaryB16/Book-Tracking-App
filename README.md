# Book Tracking App

This is the 7th project that I did for Udacity Front-End program during my Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship. It was written using React library. 

## Description
The application was written from scratch using the [Create react App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) build

It follows the Udacity guidelines/requirements and It's using the book database provided by them 
( You can find more information about the database [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) )

The application lets the user add books to a virtual bookshelf. It displays the books under three categorized bookshelves: currently reading, want to read and read. The user searches the books in a database and it can add books, from the search page, to one of the three bookshelves. 

## Getting Started

In order to run this app on your computer all you need to do is:

* Install npm (if you don't have it already) [link here](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Clone or download the repository.
* Go to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the project.
* Open the Command Line and run:`npm install`. (Alternatively if you are familiar with React and it's packages you can use `yarn install`
    - This project uses the following react package that will be installed automatically: *react-router-dom*.
* To start the application use command line `npm start`.
    - The application will open in a new browser tab/window. By default server runs on port 3000.
